She works hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money
So you better treat her right
She works hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money
So you better treat her right
Onetta there in the corner stand
And she wonders where she is
And it's strange to her
Some people seem to have everything
Nine a.m. on the hour hand
And she's waiting for the bell
And she's looking real pretty
Just wait for her clientele
She works hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money
So you better treat her right
She works hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money
So you better treat her right
